                <h2 class="greeting" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">What is design?</h2>
                <p class="mid-text">
                    When people hear "design" they often think digital art or simply making things look "cool".
                    There was a point in my life when I thought that too. Coming to college and getting
                    professional teaching in design, I've learned that design is not actually all that much about
                    aesthetics, but the curation of visual and interactive elements to craft an experience.<br /><br />

                    In the professional setting, you will often hear that "design is an iterative process." This refers
                    to
                    the idea that no product is ever fully done, but that there can always be improvements,
                    thus lending the idea that design is an iterative process that forms products through
                    rounds of iteration.

                    Hi, I'm Rebecca!<br />
                    I'm a second-year student studying Computer Science
                    and Design at Northeastern University in Boston.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="subheading gray">I am passionate about understanding how people think and behave.</p>
                <p class="mid-text">
                    In design, I have found a discipline where I can apply my insights and fuel my passion.
                    Whether it's in coding or visual design, I work with the human nature in mind,
                    aiming to create quality products that new users can interact with in a familiar way.<br /><br />

                    I have experience in UI/UX, design, web development, and data visualization, but
                    looking to being a part of anything that combines tech, design, and data to
                    create something meaningful and useful for our world.
