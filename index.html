    <p>Any well-designed web app will hit every level of design success.</p><br />
    <p>First off, the design should successfully hit the <span class="bold">aesthetic appeal</span>. It's the most basic
        level of design
        success, but surprisingly many websites still fall short. This is because a lot of aesthetic appeal
        actually comes from success in other levels of design success like hierarchy and engagement which will be
        covered later.</p>
    <br /><br />
    <div class="row">
        <img src="hierarchy1.png" width="50%" />
        <img src="hierarchy2.png" width="50%" />
    </div>
    <p>
        Some ways to ensure aesthetic appeal are consistent typeface choices, a refined color palette, and hierarchical
        order.

    <br /><br /><br />

    <p>Next, the design must also <span class="bold">craft an experience</span>. The more difficult and subtle of the different
        levels of design success, this aspect takes deeper understanding of how people think and behave.
    </p><br /><br />

    <img src="icons.png" width="80%" /><br />
    <p>The aspect of this level that differs from the aesthetic level is that design choices are not for pleasure,
        but for engagement and information, using color to differentiate an element in a group, like how the "Amazing
        views" category is black instead of gray like the other AirBnb categories. This particular
        part of the AirBnb website also utilizes an important heuristic of using icons and symbols synonymous
        to real-world items. This allows for easier processing on the user's end.

    <img src="hover.png" width="80%" />
    <p> In this image, the Experiences page button is highlighted when hovered (imagine a cursor; the screenshot
        didn't get it). This is another subtle interaction that lets the user know that what 
        they're hovering over is clickable. It responds to the user's behavior, making it feel like
        they are interacting with the website rather reading through it like a book.
